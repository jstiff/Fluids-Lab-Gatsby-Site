Gas migration through soft granular materials.

Gas migration through a soft, liquid-saturated granular material involves a strong coupling between the motion of the gas and the deformation of the material. This process is central to many natural and industrial systems, such as the venting of gas from lake beds, waste ponds, and even volcanoes. We use high-resolution experiments and a simple mechanistic model to link grain-scale fluid and solid mechanics with macroscopic migration, trapping, and venting. We find that the largest amount of trapping and the largest venting events occur at intermediate confining stress.
