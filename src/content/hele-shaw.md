We experimentally inject oil into the mixture of the same oil and non-colloidal particles inside a Hele-Shaw cell, to investigate the connection between miscible fingering and the interfacial structure that develops inside the thin gap. Previous studies with pure fluids have demonstrated that the onset of miscible fingering coincides with the transition from a smooth to blunt interfacial shape, which can be modified by enhancing interfluid diffusion (or mixing). In the present study with suspensions, mixing between invading oil and the suspension is primarily driven by shear-induced migration of particles across streamlines, which depends on the particle concentration and the particle diameter relative to the gap thickness. Specifically, by tuning the channel confinement relative to the particle size, we demonstrate that we can enhance shear-induced diffusion of particles and cause the interfacial shape to become more rounded, which results in changes in fingering morphologies. The results of our study suggest a potential use of the wall confinement to control hydrodynamic instabilities uniquely in suspensions.
