Particle-induced viscous fingering

To isolate the coupling between fluid-fluid interfaces and suspended particles, we experimentally demonstrated that the suspension-air interface becomes unstable and leads to the formation of particle clusters, when a particle-oil mixture radially displaces air inside a Hele-Shaw cell. Note that the oil-air interface in the same flow configuration is stable without the presence of particles. This particle-induced viscous fingering arises from the accumulation of particles on the advancing oil-air interface, which generates the unstable viscosity gradient inside the suspension. We employed the continuum model to verify that the particles migrate towards the centerline (known as shear-induced migration) and, on average, move faster than the mixture, which causes particle accumulation on the interface. We also performed the stability analysis to predict the most unstable wavenumber and extended this study to bi-disperse suspensions and inward viscous fingering upon drainage.
